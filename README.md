# Nand2Tetris Solutions

These are my solutions to [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) projects. My Visual Studio Code settings are available [here](https://github.com/Bozar/VisualStudioCodeSetting) and I recommend `throvn.nand2tetris` extension for writing homework. I learn Python by reading `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`.
